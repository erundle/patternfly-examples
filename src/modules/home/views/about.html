PatternFly’s mission is to deliver user centered design solutions for enterprise web applications the open source way. 

PatternFly is a living project that we are working to continually expand and improve. It’s a place where open source developers and designers can collaborate, create, and share user interface (UI) patterns, components and widgets. 

PatternFly is based on Bootstrap, a mobile-first front-end framework for creating web sites and applications as well as numerous other open source libraries to create a complete widget toolkit. The reference implementation bits can be obtained from the GitHub repository via Git clone, by downloading a zip file from the GitHub website, as an RPM, or via Bower, a front-end package manager. Bower provides a simple way to find, install, update, and manage front-end dependencies via a command-line interface.

Our design process is iterative; the best ideas win until a new and better idea comes along. We value collaboration and invite anyone to participate in our effort to improve user experience across enterprise applications. Visit the Contribute page to learn more about how to get involved.
