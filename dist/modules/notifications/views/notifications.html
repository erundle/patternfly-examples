  <h1 class="page-title">Alerts</h1>
</div>
<p>These alerts are used inline to display system information to the user. They should be placed at the top or bottom of a section? Success and Information messages can either be dismissed by clicking the close "X" or fade away after 10 seconds. Warning and Error messages should always be explicitly dismissed by the user.</p>
<p>What happens if you get more than 1 message? Do they stack?</p>
